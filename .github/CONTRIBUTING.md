# Contributing
Hey, I'm glad that you want to contribute to this project!

If you wish to contribute to Neo, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.

I use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice is a great boon to your development progress.

## Setup
To get ready to work on the code, please do the following:
1. Fork & clone the repo, and make sure you're on the **main** branch.
2. Run `npm ci`
3. Code it all you want!
4. Test the bot!
   *NOTE: Make sure there is no any error while executing commands.*
5. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/Loominagit/Neo/compare) and explain why you submitted a pull request. (e.g. fixing bug, adding features, etc...).
